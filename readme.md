##A website template by [Rich Abdill](http://richabdill.com)

A very simple package requiring minimal programming experience to get up and running. 
Just place the files on a web server and you're good to go. Customize the text placeholders in
index.html, and if you plan to use the included email contact form, remember to edit email_form.php 
to fill in the variables it asks for. If you don't, your website won't know where to send your messages.

*Note: The email contact form requires a server running PHP. Feel free to just chop the thing out 
if all you want is a nice little HTML/CSS template. There's a little Javascript hiding in there too, just FYI.*
